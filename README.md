COVID-19 kills older people more often. 99% of the deaths are for people that
are 50 or older. That's not to say younger people who contract the virus does
not have impacts: "some recovered patients may have reduced lung function and
are left gasping for air while walking briskly" ([source][scmp]).

For the restaurant bookings chart, I used the data from OpenTable's "[The state of the restaurant industry]"

### Health care breakdown estimation
The number of infections I estimate each country can handle comes from Italy's
health care system being overrun, which happened when the had approximately
12,500 cases when their health care system reached capacity. I scale each
countries infection density by the percent of the population over 65 and the
number of "critical care beds".  This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation
that only relies on all health care systems being equally capable.

To estimate the number of cases each country can handle, I use this
equation:

``` python
# Measures how much greater concentration the given country can handle
ratio = (frac_over_65 / italy_frac_over_65) * (n_beds / italy_beds)

# Scale by population
limit = ratio * (pop / italy_pop) * italy_cases_breakdown
```
